## Usage

To use pilfer either download a binary from the releases page or building it
locally with

```sh
cargo install --git https://github.com/Eludris/pilfer.git
```

Pilfer defaults to using @ooliver1's Eludris instance located at <https://eludris.tooty.xyz/>,
to change that overwrite the `REST_URL` and `GATEWAY_URL` environment variables.
